        question: "What is a mortgage note?",
        answer: "A mortgage note is a legal document that obligates a borrower to repay a loan at a stated interest rate during a specified period of time. It creates a security interest in the property and represents the debt instrument for the loan."
      },
      {
        question: "How do I evaluate a note before buying?",
        answer: "When evaluating a note, you should consider several factors: payment history, borrower's credit, property value, remaining term, interest rate, and yield. Our platform provides key metrics and documentation to help you make informed decisions."
      },
      {
        question: "What documents should I review before purchasing?",
        answer: "You should review the original note, mortgage or deed of trust, payment history, title report, property appraisal, and borrower's credit report when available. Our sellers are encouraged to provide comprehensive documentation."

      },
      {
        question: "How is ROI calculated for note investments?",
        answer: "Return on Investment (ROI) for notes is calculated by dividing the total expected payments (monthly payment Ã— remaining payments) minus the purchase price, by the purchase price, expressed as a percentage. This gives you the potential return on your investment."

    category: "Selling Notes",

      },
      {
        question: "What documents do I need to provide when selling a note?",
        answer: "You should provide the original note, mortgage or deed of trust, payment history, property information, and any relevant appraisals or title reports. Comprehensive documentation increases buyer confidence and can lead to faster sales."
      },
      {
        question: "How should I price my note?",
        answer: "Note pricing typically reflects a discount to the remaining balance based on various risk factors. Consider the payment history, property value, interest rate, remaining term, and borrower creditworthiness. Our platform provides guidance on competitive pricing based on market trends."
      },
      {
        question: "What fees are associated with selling a note?",
        answer: "NoteTrade charges a small commission on successful sales. There are no upfront listing fees or hidden charges. The commission structure is transparent and only applies when you successfully sell your note."
      },
      {
        question: "How long does it typically take to sell a note?",
        answer: "The timeline varies based on note quality, documentation, and pricing. Well-documented notes with strong payment histories and competitive pricing typically sell faster. Most notes with complete documentation sell within 30-60 days."
