Key Terminology

To navigate note investing, it's important to understand the following industry terms:

    Loan-to-Value (LTV): This ratio compares the loan amount to the value of the property. A lower LTV indicates the borrower has more equity, reducing the risk for the investor.

    Non-Performing Note (NPN): A note where the borrower has stopped making payments.

    Performing Note: A loan in which the borrower is making regular payments.

    Collateral: The property or asset securing the loan. In case of default, the investor may seize the collateral.

    Foreclosure: The legal process of taking possession of the property when a borrower defaults.

    Loan Servicer: A third-party company that manages the administrative tasks of loan collection and borrower communication.

Evaluating an Unseasoned Note
1. Analyze the Borrower

    Review the borrower’s credit score and payment history.

    Assess the borrower’s income stability and debt-to-income ratio (the percentage of their income that goes toward debt payments).

2. Assess the Property

    Investigate the location and market trends in the area.

    Check the condition of the property and its marketability.

    Compare it to similar properties in the area to gauge its true value.

3. Review Loan Terms

    Look at the interest rate, payment schedule, and any balloon payments or prepayment penalties.

    Understand the loan length (whether it’s short-term or long-term) and its impact on cash flow.

Making Money with Unseasoned Notes
1. Holding for Monthly Income

If the borrower continues to pay on time, you earn steady monthly income, similar to a landlord collecting rent, but without the responsibilities of property management.
2. Selling the Note

As the note shows consistent payment behavior, it becomes a seasoned note. This makes it more attractive to investors, and you can sell it for a profit.
3. Loan Modification

If the borrower struggles with payments, you can negotiate new terms to make the loan more manageable. This approach can help reduce the risk of default while maintaining the value of your investment.
4. Foreclosure & Property Acquisition

If the borrower defaults, you may have the option to acquire the property through foreclosure. If the property’s value exceeds the amount you paid for the note, this can result in significant profits.
