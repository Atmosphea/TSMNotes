AI Website Builder Prompt (Revised with Specific Points):

"I need a website designed for a secure, professional, and user-friendly marketplace for buying and selling seasoned mortgage notes. This platform will facilitate connections between note sellers (investors and servicers) and note buyers (investors). The platform will not facilitate direct transactions; instead, it will serve as a listing and communication hub, with all deals being finalized offline via traditional paper agreements.

Key Features and Functionality:

    User Authentication and Profiles:
        Implement a robust user registration and login system with secure username/password authentication.
        Create detailed user profiles for both note sellers and buyers, allowing them to showcase their experience and investment criteria.
        Include fields for contact information, company details, and relevant professional affiliations.

    Note Listing Functionality (For Sellers):
        Develop a dedicated page for note sellers to upload detailed information about their seasoned mortgage notes.
        Include input fields for:
            Loan amount (principal balance).
            Interest rate.
            Loan term (original and remaining).
            Property address (with optional map integration).
            Loan performance status (performing, non-performing).
            Detailed loan description (including collateral information, borrower history, and any relevant due diligence findings).
            Document upload capabilities (for loan documents, appraisals, and other supporting materials).
            Ability to add photos of the property.
        Implement a search function for buyers to search these listings.

    Buyer Inquiry Functionality:
        Create a separate page for potential note buyers to submit their investment criteria and contact information.
        Develop a form that allows buyers to specify their preferred loan types, geographic locations, and investment amounts.
        Implement an automated email notification system that sends buyer inquiries to all registered note sellers on the platform.

    Secure Communication:
        Integrate a secure messaging system that allows buyers and sellers to communicate directly within the platform.
        Include a contact button on each listing that directs the user to the contact form.

    Website Design and User Experience:
        Design a clean, professional, and trustworthy website with a user-friendly interface.
        Use a color palette that conveys security and reliability (e.g., blues, grays).
        Ensure the website is responsive and accessible on all devices (desktops, tablets, and mobile phones).
        Include clear navigation.
        Include a section that explains the process of how to buy and sell notes on the platform.
        Include a frequently asked questions section.

    Security Considerations:
        Prioritize data security and implement robust measures to protect user information and loan data.
        Use encryption for sensitive data and implement secure authentication protocols.
        Ensure the website complies with relevant data privacy regulations.

    Data Recovery Consideration:
        Please make the website structure allow for the future importation of data from an older website.

    No Direct Transactions:
        Emphasize that all transactions are conducted offline through traditional paper agreements.
        Include clear disclaimers that the website only facilitates connections and does not handle financial transactions.

Specific Requirements Based on BRJGROUP.NET Reference:

    Replicate Core Functionality: The website should emulate the core functionality of the former BRJGROUP.NET site, focusing on secure user accounts and efficient listing/inquiry processes.
    Loan Listing Page: Implement a dedicated page where investors and servicers can upload loan details, including:
        Loan amount.
        Interest rate.
        Loan term.
        Property address.
    Buyer Inquiry Page: Create a separate page for potential buyers to input their purchasing criteria.
    Email Notifications: Ensure that buyer inquiries are automatically emailed to all registered members of the platform.
    Secure User Accounts: Implement a secure user account system with unique usernames and passwords for each member.

Overall Tone and Messaging:

    Convey professionalism, trust, and reliability.
    Position the platform as a secure and efficient marketplace for seasoned note transactions.
    Emphasize the value of connecting buyers and sellers in a targeted and secure environment."
