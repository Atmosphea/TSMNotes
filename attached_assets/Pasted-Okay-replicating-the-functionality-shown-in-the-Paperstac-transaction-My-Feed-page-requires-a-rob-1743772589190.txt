Okay, replicating the functionality shown in the Paperstac transaction "My Feed" page requires a robust backend system focused on state management, data storage, and controlled access. Here's a breakdown of the backend requirements:

I. Database Schema:

You'll need dedicated tables to manage the transaction lifecycle:

Transactions Table:

id (Primary Key, Unique Transaction ID - e.g., 20250328...)

note_id (Foreign Key linking to the specific Notes table entry)

buyer_id (Foreign Key linking to the Users table for the buyer)

seller_id (Foreign Key linking to the Users table for the seller)

current_price (Decimal/Numeric - Agreed sale price)

platform_fee (Decimal/Numeric - Calculated fee)

total_price (Decimal/Numeric - current_price + platform_fee)

cut_off_date (Date, nullable)

closing_date (Date, nullable)

effective_date (Date, nullable)

closing_schedule_type (Enum/String - e.g., 'EscrowAndAudit')

seller_vesting_info (Text, nullable)

buyer_vesting_info (Text, nullable)

seller_servicer_info (Text, nullable)

buyer_servicer_info (Text, nullable)

buyer_shipping_address (Text, nullable)

seller_bank_wire_info (Text, nullable - Consider encrypting or storing securely)

seller_collateral_shipping_info (Text, nullable)

auditor_collateral_verification_report_url (Text, nullable - Link to the report file)

current_status (Enum/String - e.g., 'Negotiation', 'Closing', 'Completed', 'Cancelled')

created_at, updated_at (Timestamps)

TransactionTasks Table (for the To-Do List):

id (Primary Key)

transaction_id (Foreign Key linking to Transactions)

task_identifier (Enum/String - A unique key for each task, e.g., seller_accepted_sale_price, buyer_wired_funds)

status (Enum/String - e.g., 'Pending', 'Complete', 'Skipped', 'Failed')

completed_by_user_id (Foreign Key linking to Users, nullable)

completed_at (Timestamp, nullable)

phase (Enum/String - 'Negotiation', 'Closing') - Optional, helps grouping

TransactionFiles Table (for uploaded documents):

id (Primary Key)

transaction_id (Foreign Key linking to Transactions)

file_url (Text - Link to the document in cloud storage)

file_name (Text - Original filename)

file_type (Enum/String - e.g., 'PSA', 'Assignment', 'Allonge', 'DisbursementAgreement', 'CollateralVerificationReport')

uploaded_by_user_id (Foreign Key linking to Users)

uploaded_at (Timestamp)

TransactionTimelineEvents Table (for the Timeline tab):

id (Primary Key)

transaction_id (Foreign Key linking to Transactions)

event_description (Text - e.g., "Buyer accepted sale price", "Funds disbursed to Seller")

event_timestamp (Timestamp)

triggered_by_user_id (Foreign Key linking to Users, nullable - Who performed the action)

II. API Endpoints:

Your backend needs APIs to allow the frontend to fetch and update transaction data:

GET /api/transactions/:transactionId:

Fetch all details for a specific transaction ID.

Requires authentication and authorization (user must be the buyer or seller).

Returns data from the Transactions table, joined with related TransactionTasks, TransactionFiles, and TransactionTimelineEvents.

PUT /api/transactions/:transactionId:

Update mutable fields in the Transactions table (e.g., vesting info, servicer info, dates).

Requires authentication and authorization (only the relevant party can update certain fields).

Logs an event in TransactionTimelineEvents.

POST /api/transactions/:transactionId/tasks/:taskIdentifier/complete:

Mark a specific task in TransactionTasks as 'Complete'.

Requires authentication and authorization (ensure the correct user is completing the task).

Updates the task status, completed_by_user_id, and completed_at.

Logs an event in TransactionTimelineEvents.

Potentially updates the Transactions.current_status if all tasks in a phase are done.

POST /api/transactions/:transactionId/files:

Handle file uploads (integrating with your cloud storage).

Requires authentication and authorization.

Creates an entry in the TransactionFiles table.

Logs an event in TransactionTimelineEvents.

GET /api/transactions/my:

Fetch a list of transactions where the logged-in user is either the buyer or the seller.

III. Core Backend Logic & Functionality:

State Machine: Implement logic to manage the Transactions.current_status based on the completion of tasks in TransactionTasks. For example, move from 'Negotiation' to 'Closing' when all negotiation tasks are complete.

Task Management: Accurately track the status of each task in the To-Do list.

Data Validation: Validate all incoming data before saving it to the database (e.g., ensure dates are valid, vesting info format is correct).

Fee Calculation: Automatically calculate platform_fee and total_price when the current_price is set or updated.

Timeline Event Creation: Automatically create entries in TransactionTimelineEvents whenever a significant action occurs (task completion, data update, file upload).

File Handling: Securely handle file uploads to cloud storage and associate the file URL with the correct transaction and file type.

Authentication & Authorization: Ensure only the authenticated buyer or seller associated with the transaction can view or modify its data. Implement role-based checks for specific actions (e.g., only the buyer can mark "Buyer wired funds to escrow" complete).

IV. Notifications (Highly Recommended):

Implement an email or in-app notification system to alert the buyer/seller when:

Action is required from them (e.g., a task needs completion).

The other party completes a significant step.

The transaction status changes.

By implementing these backend components, you can effectively manage the complex workflow of a note transaction, providing a clear and structured experience for both buyers and sellers, similar to the Paperstac example.
