        For each input field on the note listing creation form, add an <h3> element directly above it to serve as a clear label.
    Task 2.2: Reflowable Input Boxes:
        Make the input boxes reflowable, meaning they should adjust their width and height based on the content and container size.
        make sure that the input boxes do not distort when the page is resized.

            Apply a drop shadow to the popup for visual separation.
    Task 3.4: "Listing Preview" Content:
        The popup should display a "Listing Preview" containing:
